# Finite-State Machine (FSM) in VHDL

Implementation of a **Finite-State Machine (FSM)** in VHDL that multiplies two integers and displays the result on a **7-segment display**. Developed for the **Cyclone II board**.

## Features
- Multiplication of two integers.  
- Displays the result on a 7-segment display.  
- Fully implemented in VHDL using FSM.

## Requirements
- Quartus Prime (or any compatible VHDL software).  
- **Cyclone II** development board.

## Running in Quartus
1. Open the project file (`.qpf`) in Quartus.  
2. Open the **waveform** for simulation.  
3. Enter the input numbers in **binary**.  
4. Run the simulation to verify functionality.

## Running on the Cyclone II Board
1. Compile the project in Quartus.  
2. Download the `.sof` file to the board.  
3. Use the **switches** to enter the numbers.  
4. Observe the result directly on the **7-segment display**.
   
## Notes
- Input numbers must not exceed the maximum size supported by the display.  
- Project developed for educational purposes and VHDL practice.
